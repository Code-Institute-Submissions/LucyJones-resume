## &rarr; User Experience (UX)

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an online presence for myself whilst developing my experience using HTML and CSS frameworks. My main goal is to get myself noticed and increase my chances of getting hired.

The online resume will aim to give users proof of my ability and confidence in what I can do. 

The <u>key priorities</u> for my user are as follows:

1. To easily access a hard copy of my CV
2. To view my completed projects
3. Have access to my contact details
4. Send a message whilst on site
5. View my current skills & experience

#### User stories

#### Visuals

>**It takes about 50 milliseconds for users to form an opinion about your website that determines whether theyâ€™ll stay or leave** - Peep Laja, 2020

* **Structure**
  * A simple design structure with repeated pattern making it easy for my user to navigate site

* **Color scheme**
  * Monochromatic colour scheme to keep the design looking clean and elegant 
  * Purple is most frequently associated with creativity and imagination.

* **Typography**
  * The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.


#### Wireframes

As part of the design process, before starting my project I used <u>Balsamiq</u> to create wireframes. Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.
