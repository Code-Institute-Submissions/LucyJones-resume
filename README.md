## &rarr; General info

The purpose of this project is to create an online presence for myself whilst developing my experience using HTML and CSS frameworks. My main goal is to get myself noticed and increase my chances of getting hired.

The online resume will aim to give users proof of my ability and reassurance that I will be a worthy person for the job. 

The <u>key priorities</u> for my user are as follows:

1. To easily access a hard copy of my CV
2. To view my completed projects
3. Have access to my contact Details

#### Visuals

>**It takes about 50 milliseconds for users to form an opinion about your website that determines whether theyâ€™ll stay or leave** - Peep Laja, 2020


* Simple design structure

* Repeated design - Header and footer folow the same pattern on every page making it easy for my user to navigate site

* Interactive - Map marker for homepage making my website unique and interactive for the user

* Monochromatic colour scheme - I chose a simplistic monochramatic colour scheme of purple combined with softer greys, black and white. I wanted to keep the design looking clean and elegant keeping it pleasant for the user eyes. Purple is most frequently associated with creativity and imagination.

* Fonts - Simple and readable

#### Demo
